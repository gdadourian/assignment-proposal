Project Title: EasyGrader

This software would act similarly to the NYUClasses gradebook and allow teachers (perhaps high school teachers) who do not have access to software such as NYUClasses gradebook to easily calculate the grades of their students without doing any calculations. They would simply enter the grades for each student for sections such as quizzes, exams, assignments, projects, etc. and the overall grades would be calculated automatically based on customizable parameters set by the teacher. For example, they could choose the respective "weights" of each section, decide if they want to drop the lowest X number of quizzes or homework assignments, etc. The software would not only provide an overall grade but also the total grades for each respective section of work. Perhaps the software could also allow the teachers to apply curves to their students' grades if needed. I imagine there would be a space that displays a chart that has all of the sections as well as each grade that falls under each section, and also a space where they can enter new grades. The table would ideally be automatically updated upon the submission of a new grade.
